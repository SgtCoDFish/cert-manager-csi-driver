# csi-driver

csi-driver is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver plugin for Kubernetes
to work along [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). The goal for this plugin
is to facilitate requesting and mounting certificate key pairs to pods
seamlessly. This is useful for facilitating mTLS, or otherwise securing
connections of pods with guaranteed present certificates whilst having all of
the features that cert-manager provides.

## Why a CSI Driver?

- Ensure private keys never leave the node and are never sent over the network.
  All private keys are stored locally on the node.
- Unique key and certificate per application replica with a grantee to be
  present on application run time.
- Reduce resource management overhead by defining certificate request spec
  in-line of the Kubernetes Pod template.
- Automatic renewal of certificates based on expiry of each individual
  certificate.
- Keys and certificates are destroyed during application termination.
- Scope for extending plugin behaviour with visibility on each replica's
  certificate request and termination.

[cert-manager.io](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/csi-driver/) for
